This is challenging, however, when relevant differences are subtle at the level of individual genes. We introduce an analytical strategy, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, designed to detect modest but coordinate changes in the expression of groups of functionally related genes. Using this approach, we identify a set of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation whose expression is coordinately decreased in human diabetic muscle. Expression of these genes is high at sites of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, activated by PGC-1$\alpha$ and correlated with total-body aerobic capacity. Our results associate this gene set with clinically important variation in human metabolism and illustrate the value of pathway relationships in the analysis of genomic profiling experiments.},

    abstract = "{Motivation: A gene set test is a differential expression analysis in which a P-value is assigned to a set of genes as a unit. Gene set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power, organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group.Results: We present ROAST, a statistically rigorous gene set test that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, ROAST uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on sample size, ROAST gives useful results even for experiments with minimal replication. ROAST allows for any experimental design that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate array weights and correlated samples. ROAST can be tuned for situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are actively involved in the molecular pathway. ROAST can test for uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to allow for prior importance. The power and size of the ROAST procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to that of a representative permutation method. Finally, ROAST is used to test the degree of transcriptional conservation between human and mouse mammary stems.Availability: ROAST is implemented as a function in the Bioconductor package limma available from www.bioconductor.orgContact:  smyth@wehi.edu.auSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

              permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to
              inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show

              organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed
              based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from
              the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An
              efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene

              Luirink, Joen and Hamoen, Leendert W",
  abstract = "To infer the biological meaning from transcriptome data, it is
              useful to focus on genes that are regulated by the same
              regulator, i.e., regulons. Unfortunately, current gene set
              enrichment analysis (GSEA) tools do not consider whether a gene
              is activated or repressed by a regulator. This distinction is
              crucial when analyzing regulons since a regulator can work as an
              activator of certain genes and as a repressor of other genes, yet
              both sets of genes belong to the same regulon. Therefore, simply
              averaging expression differences of the genes of such a regulon
              will not properly reflect the activity of the regulator. What
              makes it more complicated is the fact that many genes are
              regulated by different transcription factors, and current
              transcriptome analysis tools are unable to indicate which
              regulator is most likely responsible for the observed expression
              difference of a gene. To address these challenges, we developed
              the gene set enrichment analysis program GINtool. Additional
              features of GINtool are novel graphical representations to
              facilitate the visualization of gene set analyses of
              transcriptome data, the possibility to include functional
              categories as gene sets for analysis, and the option to analyze
              expression differences within operons, which is useful when
              analyzing prokaryotic transcriptome and also proteome
              data.IMPORTANCEMeasuring the activity of all genes in cells is a
              common way to elucidate the function and regulation of genes.
              These transcriptome analyses produce large amounts of data since
              genomes contain thousands of genes. The analysis of these large
              data sets is challenging. Therefore, we developed a new software
              tool called GINtool that can facilitate the analysis of
              transcriptome data by using prior knowledge of gene sets
              controlled by the same regulator, the so-called regulons. An
              important novelty of GINtool is that it can take into account the
              directionality of gene regulation in these analyses, i.e.,
              whether a gene is activated or repressed, which is crucial to
              assess whether a regulon or functional category is affected.
              GINtool also includes new graphical methods to facilitate the
              visual inspection of regulation events in transcriptome data
              sets. These and additional analysis methods included in GINtool
              make it a powerful software tool to analyze transcriptome data.",

  abstract = "Functional enrichment analysis is conducted on high-throughput
              data to provide functional interpretation for a list of genes or
              proteins that share a common property, such as being
              differentially expressed (DE). The hypergeometric P-value has
              been widely used to investigate whether genes from pre-defined
              functional terms, for example, Gene Ontology (GO), are enriched
              in the DE genes. The hypergeometric P-value has three
              limitations: (1) computed independently for each term, thus
              neglecting biological dependence; (2) subject to a size
              constraint that leads to the tendency of selecting less-specific
              terms; (3) repeated use of information due to overlapping
              annotations by the true-path rule. We propose a Bayesian approach
              based on the non-central hypergeometric model. The GO dependence
              structure is incorporated through a prior on non-centrality
              parameters. The likelihood function does not include overlapping
              information. The inference about enrichment is based on posterior
              probabilities that do not have a size constraint. This method can
              detect moderate but consistent enrichment signals and identify
              sets of closely related and biologically meaningful functional
              terms rather than isolated terms. We also describe the basic
              ideas of assumption and implementation of different methods to
              provide some theoretical insights, which are demonstrated via a
